Here I will take a project that I coded from scratch following a tutorial from Cory House at PluralSight called "Building Applications with React 18 and Redux" and I'll add new suggested features on my own such as:

1. Author Administrator (only course implemented)
2. Filter Course List
3. Hide empty course list
4. Unsaved changes message
5. Enchance validation
6. Handle 404 on edit course
7. Show the total number of course (throught redux centraized store)
8. Pagination
9. Sort course table
10.Revert abandoned messages
